                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This article provides a comprehensive timeline of 3D printing history, beginning with Charles Hullâ€™s invention of stereolithography (SLA) in the 1980s. It details the evolution of key technologies like Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), and explains how the expiration of patents in the early 2000s contributed to the growth of consumer-grade 3D printing. The article also examines how 3D printing has impacted industries such as healthcare, aerospace, and manufacturing, and discusses ongoing innovations in materials and techniques.
